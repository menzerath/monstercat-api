# Monstercat API

Go-based API to access Monstercat releases and tracks.

## Supported Features

As there is no up-to-date API documentation, this repository is based on the reverse engineering of their website.
Sadly this also means that the API may break at any time.  
For additional features open an issue or feel free to create a pull request.

* login with your Monstercat account
